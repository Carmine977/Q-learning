# Q-learning: Tower of Hanoy
Implement the solution of the Hanoi Tower game with 3 and 4 rings using Q-Learning algorithm.

The algorithm consists of two notebooks:
1) `solution-space-#-disks`: Define the solution space of the Tawer of Hanoi with # disks
2) `tower-of-hanoi-#-disks`: Implement the Q-Learning algorithm
